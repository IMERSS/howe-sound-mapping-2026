<!-- The <template> block below is written by src/js/storyBuild.js and must not be edited here: it holds the section
     knitted from a project's content/story/Curation.Rmd, whose front matter names bioreportr.curationPane as its
     paneComponent. Edit the R Markdown and knit it, then run "npm run story", which replaces everything between
     <template> and </template> and nothing else in this file. Since this component is shared between projects, the
     section written is that of the project last built - each project writes its own. The R Markdown places the form in
     a raw HTML block, ```{=html} <div @id="curationForm"></div> ``` -->
